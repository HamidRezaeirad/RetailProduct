<h1>Retail FrontEnd</h1>

Hi.

This is a sample code for implementing Front End in React.

It is a retail product catalog application with a backend that supports fuzzy searching of
products to accommodate user input errors and approximations. The front end provides a
user-friendly interface to search and display products.

## Used Technologies and Patterns

- ReactJS - The main structure of the application.
- Bootstrap - CSS framework

## Main Sections

- Product List
- Product Detail
- Fuzzy search

## Product List

- Product List displays paginated products.

## Product Detail

- Product Detail displays details of a product.

## Fuzzy search

- Fuzzy search lets end users search products with names. It will be found even if there is a typo.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm start
```

```bash
$ npm run test
```

## App is running
